166154,Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""Hello! I am 21 and I had my Skyla put in over 6 months ago. I took two ibuprofen before going to the doctor. The insertion was painful for about 30 seconds (really bad cramping). About an hour later I had some bleeding then some heavy cramps, but after taking Midol they went away. I bled for about 4 weeks straight and had some pretty bad cramps during that time. After that, my period became normal (only once a month for 4-5 days with light to normal bleeding). I do experience some bad cramping from time to time, mostly before my period and a few days after it stops, but after taking Midol or Aleve, it goes away. I also have a history of ovarian cysts and endometriosis but have not had any problems with that since my Skyla! I recommend this!""",9.0,"January 8, 2017",7
202181,Benzoyl peroxide / clindamycin,Acne,"""I applied Duac on my face as instructed and after 2 days of using it, I noticed that my pimples started to disappear but the problem is my whole face got swollen, itchy and red. I can&#039;t even sleep and go to school for days. So what I did is I visited my doctor again and told me that those were the side effects of the product and told me to stop using it. To relieve the stinging and redness I used an ice pack on my face and put moisturizer non stop. Luckily, after a few days the swelling and redness disappeared. Thank God my acne disappeared and since then whenever pimples appear on my face, I just applied the gel directly on the pimples.""",6.0,"December 23, 2013",13

It took about 45-hour to feel relief. It took my pain level from a 10 to a 4. However the first 20 minutes I felt very restless suddenly and I want to be out of the hospital, I was uncomfortable and I wanted to rip the IV out of my arm. I was paranoid waiting for my boyfriend to come back from the restroom. I couldn&#039;t explain the feeling but after reading the other posts I see it was a similar experience and side effect to the other posters.""",7.0,"January 12, 2015",22
18494,Ivermectin,Rosacea,"""I was soooo hopeful after reading all of the reviews that SooIantra would be my magic ticket to clear skin after 3 months of a severe rosacea breakout. I have been using the cream once daily for almost 4 weeks and I haven&#039;t noticed the slightest change in my skin. It&#039;s possible the papules are even worse.

29980,Klonopin,Seizure Prevention,"""This medicine made me confused, slur my words, exhausted. I was basically living in a fog for over five years. No amount of sleep helped, I needed to take a nap every day and would still be tired when I woke up. I had difficulty thinking, repeated sentences, had anxiety attacks. This medication is only suppose to be given for a maximum of 2 weeks. It&#039;s highly addictive and the user develops a high tolerance. Long-term usage can result in brain damage and benzos are the most overly prescribed drug in the world. Withdrawal was horrible, but worth it! I got my life back after getting off of it and I don&#039;t have anxiety or seizures, changed my lifestyle, diet and exercise.""",1.0,"June 22, 2016",22
222497,Kyleena,Birth Control,"""I can&#039;t speak for long term however I just had the Kyleena inserted today. I took 600mg of tylenol before my appointment which helped a lot. The insertion didn&#039;t hurt as much as these reviews led me to believe. It was just uncomfortable and a little crampy but not bad at all. I&#039;ve had it placed for about an hour and I just have minor cramping, I will update after I&#039;ve had it some time longer. I would recommend this birth control method.""",8.0,"June 26, 2017",1

89283,Celexa,Anxiety and Stress,"""Celexa helped me immensely with my social anxiety. It completely changed my personality for the better. I finally felt confident and stopped having frequent anxiety and panic attacks. 
     The only downside to taking this drug was that it was a bit too good at reducing my anxiety. I gained a total of 80 pounds in the first two years of taking it. I used to be obsessed with my weight, weighing myself multiple times a day and having anxiety attacks over it.  Celexa took away my insecurities, but at a major cost to my physical health.

I tried paxil and zoloft and hated both and felt worse on zoloft than I did with out it.

182648,Cymbalta,ibromyalgia,"""I have taken this medication for about 2 years now and it has helped me tremendously. Yes the first two weeks were hard due to nausea and diarrhea however because it controlled the pain I stayed with it. I weaned myself off at one point to make sure whether or not I still needed it but within a week of being completely off of it all the pain and muscle weakness came back so I went back on it (no side effects this time) and the pain went away so it works for me. However the Dr. said that I was his only patient who had the amount of relief I experienced with the lowest dose.  I also have Lupus (SLE) so it helps with the joint and muscle pain there too!!

34125,Tramadol,Pain,"""I take 1 to 2, 50mg tablets of tramadol a day (a very small dose) for a pulled nerve in my brachial plexis. I have been on it nearly a year. My prescription calls for me to take 1 to 2 tablets every 4 hours or as needed. I am able to get by on just 1 or 2 a day. I find tramadol not only relieves the dull pain in my neck and the other short-circuit issues one faces with a pulled nerve, but it also lightens my load, so to speak. In other words, I feel less anxious and overwhelmed when I&#039;m on it, but it&#039;s all very subtle. I don&#039;t feel like I&#039;m drugged out.

146975,Alprazolam,Anxiety,"""I grew up very &quot;shy&quot;, quiet and fearful into an adult who now chronically suffers from social/generalized anxiety, depression and OCD. As a teen into my late 20s, I was always prescribed some sort of anti-depressant, which felt like they were only doing half the job, but my anxiety and constant feeling of &quot;tightly wound&quot; was going untreated and becoming more severe. Now in my early 30s, a doc at the VA prescribed alprazolam at a daily dose up to 1-1.5mg to help with social anxiety. When I take this, I can only describe it as &quot;I feel like a normal person, this must be how everyone without social anxiety feels&quot;. It &quot;takes the edge off&quot;, but won&#039;t completely take the &quot;edge&quot; away, but it&#039;s a life changer in comparison to living without it.""",9.0,"February 18, 2016",8

Before taking this pill I was an energetic and positive person. Now I am exhausted all the time and hit a wall at 4:00 every day. My confidence has plummeted and I am experiencing extreme mood swings/anxiety/depressive symptoms. I have never experienced anxiety prior to taking this birth control and I have had multiple intense panic attacks within the past month. Other side effects have been increased heart rate, tight chest/trouble breathing, &amp; chronic headaches. I was put on yaz for my acne and it did help in some sense, but it is not worth feeling like crap 24/7.""",1.0,"August 9, 2017",11
175394,Scopolamine,Nausea/Vomiting,"""Patch used for second general anesthesia experience since I vomited after the first time.  I know they also switched me from a gas/IV combo to pure IV sedation, so although I did not vomit this time (yay!) I don&#039;t know if I can attribute it to the patch or to the sedation change, but probably both.

Please be aware these patches are NOT meant for long term use- they will have withdrawal effects! If you rebound you will have the very effects you were trying to prevent in the first place.  For my purpose, after surgery, it&#039;s worked great.  I wouldn&#039;t wear them for weeks at a time.""",9.0,"November 30, 2017",0

I took the pill exactly 24 hours after the incident &amp; experienced no side effects whatsoever. I have roughly a 32-35 day cycle, &amp; the day our incident happened was 4-5 days after my period had ended.

I maxed out on Fentanyl and had enough of the merry go round. I had crossed from dependency to addiction. After a lot of research, I felt a life in pain would be better then what I was putting myself through. I walked into a detox hospital and started Suboxone. I was stunned when my pain was under control. With incorporating a recovery program, I have been clean for 3 years and take 16mg of Suboxone.

I experienced very mild cramping, like almost none at all, plenty of discharge, nausea, and bloating. Today I got my period. I have never been so excited to see blood.
