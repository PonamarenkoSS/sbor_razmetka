Sometimes I might feel pregnant (since some of the symptoms relate) but I&#039;m generally paranoid when it comes to my body. I love my Implanon and I&#039;m greatly satisfied with it. Glad I got it best thing ever.""","high","2024-06-11T18:59:01.195932Z",22

I had unprotected sex with my boyfriend on Saturday January 30th. (A week ago today) He didn&#039;t ejaculate inside me but I realized how risky what we had done was, so the day after, approximately 25 hours after the sex, I bought a generic form of plan B. I experienced very mild cramping, like almost none at all, plenty of discharge, nausea, and bloating. Today I got my period. I have never been so excited to see blood. So I&#039;m just here to say that plan b works. I know this is easier said than done, but don&#039;t stress. It will work. symptoms sucked but worth it.  Hope I could ease your mind""","high","2024-06-11T18:59:04.413628Z",4

However I started having bad side effects from being on these for too long so stopped the treatment, within about two weeks I was having major break outs again, so depressing!! I went back to the doctors, she prescribed me epiduo. I was initially nervous about this treatment from reading reviews, but the doctor told me to start by only applying the cream a couple of times a week to let my skin get used to it, and to make sure I moisturised. It worked from first use pretty much and I&#039;m so happy!!""","high","2024-06-11T18:59:18.559918Z",5
